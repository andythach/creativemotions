			<h2>About</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Howdy and welcome! I am a junior web developer. Web development is not only my career path but also my hobby for many years now, I can spend hours and hours writing code, fixing them and go beyond my abilities. My goal is to become a full stack developer, working from front-end to back-end and onwards. I am actively looking for a respectable corporation that offer training, support and time to grow as respectable developer. When I am not infront of my computer screens, you'll find me on the field playing football or on the road for nice drive.</p>
